**Bio**

I am Zhou Qin, an algorithm engineer interested in graph neural networks, distributed systems, and functional programming. I graduated from Cornell University with a master's degree in computer science in May 2018 and then joined Alibaba Group, working with the data and algorithms team in the security department. Before that, I achieved my bachelor's degree (also major in computer science) in the South China University of Technology. 

Personally, I'd like to do some in-depth research beneath a machine learning model (i.e., seeking mathematical explanations). As a member of the editorial board for the open-source project [PumpkinBook](https://datawhalechina.github.io/pumpkin-book/#/), I am in charge of the content and quality from Chapter 8 to Chapter 16.

My work mainly focuses on applying graph neural network algorithms to identify risk commodities/buyers/sellers. We have published a [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10679) introducing our experience in applying gnn algorithms for spam review detection on Xianyu scenario.

To deal with extremely large scale graph data in Alibaba, I also participate in implementing a large scale distributed graph neural network framework [graph-learn](https://github.com/alibaba/graph-learn), which is an open-source project on GitHub.
